            <h1 class="stories">Movies</h1>
            <p>I enjoy going to movie theaters. One hard part about the Pandemic for me was <span>not</span> being able to see movies <span>in person</span>.</p>

            <p>Favorite Movies:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Mulholland Drive</li>
                <li>Men in Black</li>
                <li>Blue</li>
            </ul>

        <div id="div3">
            <h1 class="stories">Books</h1>
            <p>I've always enjoyed books but don't have as much time as I'd like to read.</p>
        </div>


        <div id="div4">
            <h1 class="stories">Parks</h1>
            <p>I live in a crowded city. Parks help me reconnect with nature and have some much needed quiet time.</p>
